## Introduction

From the documentation:

> `nwreadinglist` is an application designed to run automated data analysis tasks on `Reading List.xlsx`. This file is the one I use to annotate all the books I study in my continuous education journey. As a second set of features, it converts some of the analyses to `Markdown` files, so that I can easily show them on my `Github` account.
