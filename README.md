## Introduction

From the documentation:

> nwreadinglist is a Jupyter Notebook designed to analyze the Excel file I use to annotate all the books I study in my continuous education journey. As a second set of features, it converts some of the analyses to Markdown files, so that I can easily show them on my Github account.
