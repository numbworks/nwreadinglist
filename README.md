## In short

From the documentation:

> nwreadinglistmanager is a Jupyter Notebook designed to analyze the Reading List.xlsx file I use to annotate all the books I study in my continuous education journey. As a second set of features, it converts some of the analyses to Markdown files, so that I can easily show them on my `Github` account.

## Download the source code

I assume you are on `Windows`, but the library should compile without issues on `Linux` as well. Please:

1. Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win);
2. Open `Windows Powershell` (or `Windows Terminal` or similar) and type:

```powershell
PS C:\> mkdir nwreadinglistmanager
PS C:\> cd .\nwreadinglistmanager\
PS C:\nwreadinglistmanager> git clone https://github.com/numbworks/nwreadinglistmanager.git
```

3. Open `src/nwreadinglistmanager.ipynb` with `Visual Studio Code` or other `Jupyter Notebook`-enabled environment;
4. Done!
